  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port

  # using a specific IP.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.
